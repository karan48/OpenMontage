### Present Both Composition Runtimes (HARD RULE)

When both Remotion and HyperFrames are available on the machine (check `video_compose.get_info()["render_engines"]`), the agent **MUST present both options to the user** before locking `render_runtime` at the proposal stage. The agent MAY recommend one with rationale — but silently picking a "default" is forbidden even when the pipeline manifest or a director skill suggests one.

The presentation MUST include, for each runtime:

1. A one-sentence plain-language description of what it is best at for **this specific brief**.
2. A one-sentence honest tradeoff (why it might not be the right pick here).
3. The agent's recommendation and the reason, tied to the brief's delivery_promise and visual approach.

Then wait for explicit user approval before advancing. Record the full shortlist — BOTH runtimes plus any "ffmpeg" option that applies — as `options_considered` in the `render_runtime_selection` decision logged in `decision_log`. A decision log entry with only one runtime considered when both were available is a CRITICAL reviewer finding.

Exception: if only one runtime is available on the machine, the agent proceeds with it but MUST say so explicitly ("HyperFrames isn't installed on this machine; I'm proceeding with Remotion. Install HyperFrames if you want the alternative."). The `render_runtime_selection` decision still records the unavailable option as `rejected_because: "runtime not available on this machine"`.

This rule applies to every pipeline that invokes `video_compose` — not just Wave 1. A pipeline's director skill may recommend a runtime, but that recommendation is input to the conversation with the user, not a decision.

### Composition Authoring Mode — Templated vs Atelier

Orthogonal to *runtime* is *authoring mode*: **how** the composition is built. Present it as its own proposal decision and log it in `decision_log` (`category: "composition_mode"`).

- **Templated** — assemble the stock `cut.type` scene-types (`text_card`, `stat_card`, `bar_chart`, …) into the `Explainer`/`CinematicRenderer` compositions. Fast, cheap, reliable — and the reason most videos look alike. Right for batch output, localization variants, quick drafts, and low-stakes internal clips.
- **Atelier** — **hand-author the composition from scratch**: bespoke scenes, a one-off theme, and motion written for this piece, rendered via `composition_mode: "atelier"` (see `video_compose` → `_render_via_atelier`). No reusable creative components; a fresh visual language every time.

**Default to atelier for hero work** — marketing, launches, brand pieces, any single-deliverable explainer that must impress. The deciding rule: *reuse engine knowledge, never creative components.* In atelier mode the stock scene-type catalog, `hyperframes-registry` blocks, fixtures, and finished components are **off-limits** — they are frozen looks that reintroduce sameness. Before building, route through **`skills/meta/taste-direction.md`** to set the design read and taste dials, then **`skills/meta/bespoke-composition.md`**, which sequences: art direction (`visual-style`) → motion principles (Disney 12 via `framer-motion`/`lottie-bodymovin`) → engine mechanics (`remotion-best-practices` + the stock components read *only as a mechanics codex*) → render via the atelier path. Close with a **distinctness review**: *could this be any other product's video? does it reuse a look I've made before?* — the inverse of "does it match the reference." Atelier costs more tokens and iteration than templated; say so at proposal so the user opts in knowingly.

### Composition Runtimes (Inside video_compose)

`video_compose` has **three** render engines / runtimes. They are parallel, not ranked — the choice is made at proposal and locked in `edit_decisions.render_runtime`. Check which are available:

```bash
python -c "
from tools.tool_registry import registry
registry.discover()
info = registry._tools['video_compose'].get_info()
print('Render engines:', info.get('render_engines'))
print('Remotion note:', info.get('remotion_note'))
print('HyperFrames note:', info.get('hyperframes_note'))
"
```

| Engine | Used For | Requires |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **FFmpeg** | Video-only cuts, concat, trim, subtitle burn | `ffmpeg` binary (always available) |
| **Remotion** | React-based composition: still images → animated video, text cards, stat cards, charts, callouts, comparisons, transitions with spring physics, word-level caption burn, TalkingHead avatar | Node.js (`npx`) + `remotion-composer/` + `node_modules` |
| **HyperFrames** | HTML/CSS/GSAP composition: kinetic typography, product promos, launch reels, website-to-video, registry-block-driven scenes, SVG character rigs | Node.js ≥ 22 + FFmpeg + `npx` (consumed via `npx hyperframes`) |

`render_runtime` is **locked at proposal** (`proposal_packet.production_plan.render_runtime`) and **carried through edit_decisions unchanged**. `video_compose` routes based on this field; silent runtime swaps are forbidden. If the chosen runtime becomes unavailable at compose time, surface a structured blocker per "Escalate Blockers Explicitly" above. See `skills/core/hyperframes.md` for the Remotion-vs-HyperFrames decision matrix.

### Critical Rule: Motion-Required Requests

For any request where the deliverable inherently depends on motion rather than static coverage, treat motion as a hard requirement. Examples:

- sci-fi trailers,
- cinematic teasers built from generated clips,
- hype edits,
- avatar or agent videos,
- any brief whose promise depends on moving shots rather than still frames.

For these requests:

- The `render_runtime` chosen at proposal (Remotion, HyperFrames, or FFmpeg) must be confirmed available up front if the planned visual treatment depends on it.
- Still-image fallback is forbidden. Do not quietly convert the job into a Ken Burns teaser, animatic, or slide-based video.
- FFmpeg-only fallback is forbidden when it changes the approved deliverable from motion-led video to still-led video.
- **Silent runtime swap is forbidden.** If `render_runtime="hyperframes"` was locked and HyperFrames is unavailable, do NOT route to Remotion instead. Surface the blocker, propose options, get user approval, log a `render_runtime_selection` decision — then proceed.
- Bubble critical issues immediately. If the chosen runtime is unavailable, fails to render, or provider clip generation fails in a way that blocks the approved treatment, stop and tell the user before proceeding.
- Do not spend more tokens or time on downgraded output unless the user explicitly approves the downgrade as an animatic or proof-of-concept.

**When Remotion is available**, the agent should design production plans around it:
- Explainer videos with `flat-motion-graphics` playbook -> Remotion animated scenes, not Ken Burns
- Data-driven videos -> Remotion stat cards and charts, not static image screenshots
- Any pipeline using still images -> Remotion spring animations, not FFmpeg pan-and-zoom
- **Screen demos of a CLI/terminal/install flow -> `TerminalScene` (synthetic screen recording), not OS-level capture.** See `.agents/skills/synthetic-screen-recording/SKILL.md`. Faster, deterministic, privacy-safe. Use real capture (`screen_recorder`, `cap_recorder`, `playwright-recording`) only when the demo is a real app UI or requires unpredictable live behavior.

### Remotion scene types available in `remotion-composer/`

See `remotion-composer/SCENE_TYPES.md` for the authoritative list and their cut schemas. Current scene types usable via `cut.type`:
`text_card`, `stat_card`, `callout`, `comparison`, `hero_title`, `terminal_scene`, `anime_scene`, `bar_chart`, `line_chart`, `pie_chart`, `kpi_grid`, `progress_bar`. Overlay types include `section_title`, `stat_reveal`, `hero_title`, `provider_chip`.

These stock scene-types are the **templated** path — fast and reliable, but they are why videos look alike. For **hero work, prefer atelier mode** (hand-authored composition) over this catalog; read those types as a *mechanics codex*, not a menu to assemble. See "Composition Authoring Mode" above and `skills/meta/bespoke-composition.md`.

**When Remotion is NOT available** and `render_runtime="remotion"` was NOT locked, `video_compose` may use FFmpeg Ken Burns motion on still images. This still works but produces less engaging visuals. Mention this tradeoff in the proposal. When `render_runtime="remotion"` IS locked and Remotion is unavailable, that's a blocker — escalate, don't silently swap.

When `render_runtime="hyperframes"` is locked and HyperFrames is unavailable (Node < 22, missing `ffmpeg`/`npx`, or `hyperframes doctor` reports issues), that's also a blocker. Do not substitute Remotion or FFmpeg without user approval + a logged `render_runtime_selection` decision.

Routing is automatic — `video_compose` reads `edit_decisions.render_runtime` and dispatches to the matching engine (`_render_via_hyperframes`, `_remotion_render`, or `_render_via_ffmpeg`). But the **agent must know both Remotion and HyperFrames exist at proposal time** so it can design the visual approach intentionally. Don't default to Remotion for motion-graphics-heavy concepts that HTML/GSAP would express more naturally, and don't default to HyperFrames for briefs that reuse the existing React scene stack.
