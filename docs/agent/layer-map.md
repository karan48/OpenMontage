# Agent Guide — Architecture, Layer Map and Style Playbooks

> **Read when:** before the first generation-tool call (Layer 3 lookup), when choosing a playbook, or when you need the architecture overview.

## What OpenMontage Is

OpenMontage is an instruction-driven video production system. The AI agent IS the intelligence — it reads instructions (pipeline manifests + stage director skills + meta skills) and drives the pipeline using tools.

```
Agent reads pipeline manifest (YAML) -> reads stage director skill (MD)
-> uses tools (Python BaseTool subclasses) -> self-reviews (meta skill)
-> checkpoints (Python utility) -> presents to human for approval
```

**Python = tools + persistence.** No orchestration logic, creative decisions, review logic, or checkpoint policy in Python code. The agent makes those decisions guided by instructions.

Core loop:

1. Select a pipeline.
2. Run preflight.
3. Discover real tools from the registry.
4. Present the user with concepts, tool plan, production plan, and cost.
5. Execute stage by stage with checkpoints.

## Style Playbooks

| Playbook | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| `clean-professional` | Corporate, educational, SaaS |
| `premium-minimalist` | Investor updates, expert explainers, product narratives |
| `flat-motion-graphics` | Social media, TikTok, startups |
| `minimalist-diagram` | Technical deep-dives, architecture |
| `vox-explainer` | Story-driven YouTube explainers and myth-busting narrative documentaries (Vox "Explained"/"Glad You Asked" style) — documentary photos, animated maps/charts, red keyword-highlight typography, curiosity-paced cuts |
| `ink-sketch` (Ink Theater) | Hand-drawn ink-on-white doodle animation; a character that draws itself, walks, dances; contraption explainers |
| `cinematic-documentary` | Cinematic documentaries, long-form and Shorts — teal-amber film grade, parallax stills plus stock motion, hook → escalation → reveal → loop-back |
| `toon-story` | 2D cartoon stories with a recurring rigged cast, episodes and Shorts — flat vector, thick outlines, Disney-12 cartoon acting |
| `tech-review` | Product reviews, long-form and Shorts — dark studio product hero, spec cards, pros/cons, comparison tables, verdict card |
| `lifestyle-reel` | Lifestyle vlogs and Shorts/Reels with a recurring on-screen persona — warm natural light, maroon/gold brand cards |
| `anime-drama` | Young-adult drama and romance with modern anime-style illustrated stills, episodes and Shorts — luminous skies, rain and petal particles, voiced characters |

Channel profiles (`channels/<id>/channel.yaml`) name each channel's default playbook. See "Channel Profiles" above.

For custom, atelier, brand, launch, or hero work, read `skills/meta/taste-direction.md` before choosing a playbook. Carry its `taste_profile` into the proposal so later stages can preserve the design read, visual variance, motion intensity, information density, reference strategy, and anti-patterns.

### Hand-drawn "doodle" animation → Ink Theater / Ink Puppet

For any brief that wants a **hand-drawn ink doodle** look — "a sketch that comes to life", "a pencil / stick figure that walks or dances", "a little character that acts out the idea", whiteboard-doodle explainers — use the **Ink Theater** engine + **Ink Puppet** mocap system (`skills/creative/ink-theater.md`, `ink-theater/README.md`). It is a **style + reusable engine, not a new pipeline**: illustration / contraption pieces run on the `animation` pipeline; a mocap character (draws itself → walks / dances / waves via `InkPuppet.choreograph([...])`) runs on `character-animation`. Cross-tool entry points: **`/ink-art`** (create a vector doodle from scratch) and **`/animated-drawing`** (animate a *supplied* drawing with mocap — raster; `skills/creative/animated-drawing.md`). Never hand-tune character motion — the agent only chooses named mocap clips.

## Layer Map

OpenMontage has three instruction layers:

1. `tools/`
   What exists, what is available, cost, runtime, fallback, related skills.
2. `skills/`
   How OpenMontage wants those tools used in pipelines.
3. `.agents/skills/`
   Raw vendor or technology knowledge.

Reading order:

1. registry / tool contract — discover what's available
2. relevant pipeline or creative skill (Layer 2) — know HOW to use it in this context
3. underlying vendor skill (Layer 3) — **mandatory before calling any generation tool**

**Prefer skills over source code for tool usage.** Skills exist precisely so you don't need implementation details in the common case. Layer 2 tells you *what* and *when*. Layer 3 tells you *how*. For authoring prompts, choosing parameters, or understanding usage patterns, you should be reading skills — not `.py` files.

**Exception: debugging, audits, and verifying the governance contract.** When a skill and a tool disagree, or when something behaves differently than the skill claims, reading the tool source is fair game — that's often the only way to catch a silent-availability bug or a stale doc string. An audit that refuses to look at the implementation will miss exactly the bugs that matter most. If you do read source to debug, consider whether the finding belongs in a skill update afterward so the next agent doesn't need to repeat the dive.

**Layer 3 is not optional.** Every generation tool (video, image, TTS, music) has an `agent_skills` field listing its Layer 3 skills. These skills contain provider-specific prompt engineering, parameter tuning, and quality techniques. Read them before writing prompts. The difference between a generic prompt and a skill-informed prompt is the difference between "usable" and "cinematic."

Example: Before calling `kling_video`, read its `agent_skills` → `ai-video-gen` → get Kling-specific prompt structure, camera direction syntax, and quality keywords that the model responds to best.

### Layer 3 skills, by category

The `.agents/skills/` directory is large. When you're not coming in through a tool's `agent_skills` pointer, use this table to find the right file by *what you're trying to do*:

| Category | Skills |
|---|---|
| **Composition runtime** | `remotion`, `remotion-best-practices`, `synthetic-screen-recording` (fake terminal/UI demos via Remotion TerminalScene) |
| **Animation knowledge (generic)** | `gsap-core`, `gsap-timeline`, `gsap-plugins` (SplitText / MorphSVG / DrawSVG / MotionPath / Flip / CustomEase), `gsap-utils`, `gsap-react`, `gsap-performance`, `gsap-scrolltrigger`, `gsap-frameworks`, `framer-motion` (Disney 12 principles), `lottie-bodymovin` (Lottie export) |
| **Character animation** | `character-rigging`, `svg-character-animation`, `pose-library-design`, `canvas-procedural-animation`, `character-animation-qa` |
| **Image generation** | `bfl-api`, `flux-best-practices`, `reference-image-edit` (Meta Muse edit / FLUX Kontext: a known character in a new scene, for `fal_reference_image`) |
| **Video generation** | `seedance-2-0` (preferred premium default — cinematic, trailer, multi-shot, synced audio, lip-sync), `gemini-omni` (conversational video editing, reference tags, timecoded beats), `ai-video-gen`, `ltx2` |
| **Audio** | `elevenlabs`, `music`, `sound-effects`, `acestep`, `text-to-speech`, `setup-api-key` |
| **Speech-to-text** | `speech-to-text` (whisper `transcriber` — default, offline), `azure-speech-to-text` (optional cloud STT — tool `azure_stt`, preferred when `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY` is set) |
| **Avatar / lip-sync** | `avatar-video`, `heygen`, `create-video`, `faceswap`, `video-translate`, `agents` |
| **Capture** | `playwright-recording` (browser flows), `ffmpeg` (post) |
| **Visualization** | `beautiful-mermaid`, `d3-viz`, `manim-composer`, `manimce-best-practices`, `manimgl-best-practices` |
| **Media editing** | `video-edit`, `video-download`, `video-understand`, `video-toolkit`, `visual-style` |

**When in doubt, read the category's meta routing file first:**
- Picking an animation runtime? → `skills/meta/animation-runtime-selector.md` routes between Remotion primitives, GSAP plugins, framer-motion, Lottie, Manim, D3.
- Picking a screen-recording mode (real capture vs synthetic terminal)? → `pipeline_defs/screen-demo.yaml` + `skills/pipelines/screen-demo/idea-director.md`.

## Quick Lookup

| Question | Where to look |
|----------|---------------|
| What tools exist? | `tools/tool_registry.py` and `registry.support_envelope()` |
| What providers are available for a capability? | `registry.capability_catalog()` |
| What tools exist for a vendor? | `registry.provider_catalog()` |
| How does a tool actually work? | the tool's `usage_location` from the registry |
| How should this pipeline stage behave? | `skills/pipelines/<pipeline>/...` |
| What is the checkpoint/review policy? | `skills/meta/` |
