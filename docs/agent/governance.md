# Agent Guide — Governance (full text)

## Decision Communication Contract

For any meaningful production decision, the agent must communicate the decision before acting. The user should never have to infer which provider, model, or render path was chosen after the fact.

### Announce Before Execution

Before any paid or consequential generation call, state:

- the exact tool name,
- the provider,
- the model or provider variant,
- the reason it was chosen,
- whether it is a sample or a batch run.

### Ask Before Major Changes

The agent must ask the user before changing any major production choice, including:

- switching provider,
- switching model family or provider variant,
- switching from video-led to still-led treatment,
- switching composition engine when that changes the output character,
- dropping narration, music, or other approved creative elements,
- changing from sample mode to batch mode.

Minor prompt refinements inside an already approved provider/model path do not require separate approval unless they materially change the creative direction.

### Re-log Changed Decisions (Binding)

The `decision_log` is the board's Decisions rail and the run's audit trail. It is **append-only history, not a scratchpad.** When a choice you already logged changes mid-run — the user swaps the voice, you switch provider/model/runtime/music, or a fallback overrides an earlier pick — you MUST **append a new `decision_log` entry** for the new choice, reusing the **same `category` AND the same `subject`** (e.g. `category: "voice_selection"`, `subject: "Narration TTS provider"`), with the superseded option moved into `options_considered` and `rejected_because` noting it was changed.

Editing only a downstream artifact (the `asset_manifest`, a prop) while leaving the old decision in the log is a defect: the board keeps showing the stale choice (e.g. `voice → openai_onyx` after the user moved to Chirp3). The board identifies a decision by its **(category, subject) pair** and renders the latest entry for that pair as current (tagged "revised") — so the fix is to append the new entry with an identical `subject`, never to silently mutate the old one or reword the subject (a reworded subject reads as a different decision and both will show). Keeping distinct decisions in one category (e.g. TTS vs image `provider_selection`) is exactly why the pair, not the category alone, is the key. This applies at every stage, not just `idea`.

### Escalate Blockers Explicitly

When a blocker occurs, the agent must surface it immediately using this structure:

1. What was attempted
2. What failed
3. Whether the issue is auth, provider access, tool bug, or prompt/design quality
4. What options exist next
5. Which option the agent recommends, with reasoning

Do not continue with a substitute path until the user approves.

### Recommendation Style

When asking the user to choose, do not just list options. The agent should:

- provide the shortlist,
- explain the tradeoffs briefly,
- recommend one option,
- wait for approval before proceeding.

### No Unilateral Substitutions

If the approved path is blocked, the agent may investigate and prepare alternatives, but may not execute those alternatives without user approval.

This applies especially to:

- provider swaps,
- model swaps,
- fallback tools,
- prompt-only substitutes for reference-driven generation,
- still-image animatics in place of true motion.

## First Interaction — Onboarding

When the user's first message is vague, exploratory, or asks what you can do ("make me a video", "what can you do?", "help me create something", "I want to make content"), read the onboarding skill **before** doing anything else:

**Read:** `skills/meta/onboarding.md`

This skill teaches you to run discovery, classify the user's setup, present capabilities in plain language, and offer starter prompts tailored to their available tools. The goal: get the user from "curious" to "making a video" in under 60 seconds.

**Skip onboarding** when the user arrives with a specific, actionable request (e.g., "Make a 60-second explainer about black holes"). Go directly to Rule Zero.

## Reference Video Entry Point

When the user provides a **video URL or local video file as inspiration** — for example:

- "Can you make a video like this?"
- "I love this YouTube Short. Make me something similar."
- "Use this Reel as a reference."

— do **not** treat this as a generic web-search or prompt-writing request.

This is a first-class workflow in OpenMontage.

### Required behavior

1. **Read:** `skills/meta/video-reference-analyst.md`
2. **Run the reference analysis workflow** using the local analysis tools (`video_analyzer`, transcript extraction, scene detection, frame sampling)
3. **Produce a grounded summary** of what the reference is doing:
   - content
   - pacing
   - structure
   - style
   - what makes it work
4. **Then** run normal capability audit and pipeline selection
5. Present **2-3 differentiated concepts** for the user's version — not a carbon copy

### Important distinction

- **Reference-driven request:** "make me something like this" -> use `video-reference-analyst.md`
- **Source-footage request:** "edit this footage" / "cut this into clips" -> use `source_media_review` and the appropriate footage-led pipeline

If a model misses this distinction, it will often fall back to plain search + guesswork. That is incorrect for OpenMontage.

## Channel Profiles — Which Channel Is This For?

The user runs several YouTube channels. Each has its own language, format, narration voice, script style, look and policies, stored in `channels/<id>/` (`channel.yaml`, `script-guide.md`, optional `characters.md`). **Every production request belongs to a channel.**

Before Rule Zero's step 1, **read `skills/meta/channel-profiles.md`**. Then:

1. Identify the channel (`lib.channel_profile.list_channels()`). If the user didn't name one, **ask**. Never guess silently.
2. Identify the format: **long-form** (16:9) or **Shorts** (9:16). Every channel makes both, so ask if it's unclear.
3. Load the profile with `load_channel('<id>')` and the format with `resolve_format(profile, '<long_form|shorts>')`. Pass `channel=` and `video_format=` to `init_project`.
4. Use the profile's pipeline, playbook, voice, the format's structure, length, composition mode and pacing, the script guide and the character bible as the **defaults** you recommend at each stage.

A profile supplies defaults, never permission. Every gate and every rule below still applies, including "Present Both Composition Runtimes". A standing preference for one channel goes into that channel's files, not into global defaults.

**Brand intro.** If the profile has a `brand` block (Curious India does: a locked 3 s intro after the opening promise in long-form, a logo end-bug on Shorts), every production in those formats includes it. Reserve it at the script stage, place it in the scene plan, copy it at assets, mix it at compose, and write the pinned comment at publish. See "Brand intro and standing structure" in `skills/meta/channel-profiles.md`.

**Recurring characters.** When a story has named or speaking characters (always on a channel with `visuals.cast_dir`), read **`skills/meta/character-bible.md`**. Characters live in a persistent bible: locked text, then an approved master, outfits, poses and expressions. `lib/character_bible.py` builds every character prompt and reference list from it, and `fal_reference_image` draws the shot. Never hand-type a character's appearance into a prompt.

## Project Directory Convention

Every production run creates a project workspace under `projects/`. This directory is gitignored — all generated assets are regenerable.

```
projects/<project-name>/
├── artifacts/          # JSON artifacts from each stage (research_brief, script, scene_plan, etc.)
├── assets/
│   ├── images/         # Generated images (PNG)
│   ├── video/          # Generated video clips (MP4)
│   ├── audio/          # Narration segments + final mix (MP3/WAV)
│   ├── music/          # Background music track (MP3)
│   └── subtitles.srt   # Generated subtitles
└── renders/
    └── final.mp4       # Final rendered video (the deliverable)
```

**Naming convention**: Use kebab-case derived from the video title (e.g., `hidden-math-of-nature`, `how-music-rewires-brain`).

At pipeline initialization, before any stage runs:

1. **Initialize the workspace**: `python -c "from lib.checkpoint import init_project; init_project('<project-id>', title='<Title>', pipeline_type='<pipeline>', channel='<channel-id>', video_format='<long_form|shorts>')"` — creates the layout above and writes `project.json` (the marker the Backlot board reads). Omit `channel` and `video_format` only for a production that belongs to no channel (see "Channel Profiles").
2. **Open the board**: run `python -m backlot open <project-id>`. This starts the Backlot server if needed and opens the user's browser at the project's live board. If the command fails, continue the production — the board is an observer, never a blocker. This is the agent's ONLY board duty; the board derives everything else from disk.

All tools and agents must write outputs to these paths — **always pass an explicit `output_path` under `projects/<project-id>/`**. Assets written to the repo root, cwd, or temp dirs are invisible to the user's board and violate the workspace contract.

**This applies to atelier and HyperFrames-skill runs too**: hand-authored compositions still write the canonical artifacts they have (script or beats-plan, scene_plan-equivalent, asset manifest) plus checkpoints into `projects/<project-id>/`. The board is runtime-agnostic; only runs that skip the artifacts get a degraded board.

## Stage Agents

Each stage produces one canonical artifact that becomes the contract for the next stage. The stage director skill teaches the agent HOW to produce it.

| Stage | Director Skill | Canonical output | Core quality bar |
|------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| `idea` | `*-director.md` | `brief` | Clear hook, target platform, duration, tone, and user intent |
| `script` | `*-director.md` | `script` | Structured sections, valid timing, coherent narration |
| `scene_plan` | `*-director.md` | `scene_plan` | Ordered scenes, timings, asset requirements |
| `assets` | `*-director.md` | `asset_manifest` | Provenance, paths, model/tool metadata, scene linkage |
| `edit` | `*-director.md` | `edit_decisions` | Concrete cuts, overlays, subtitle/music decisions |
| `compose` | `*-director.md` | `render_report` | Output paths, encoding profile, verification notes |

Stage contract rules:

- A completed or awaiting-human checkpoint must include the stage's canonical artifact.
- Canonical artifacts must validate against the JSON schema in `schemas/artifacts/`.
- Non-canonical outputs such as media files belong in stage-specific directories.
- Tools should record seeds/model versions for reproducibility.

## Communication Protocol

Agents coordinate through canonical JSON artifacts, checkpoints, pipeline manifests, and the tool registry.

Primary files:

- Artifact schemas: `schemas/artifacts/`
- Checkpoint schema: `schemas/checkpoints/checkpoint.schema.json`
- Pipeline manifest schema: `schemas/pipelines/pipeline_manifest.schema.json`
- Pipeline manifests: `pipeline_defs/`
- Style playbooks: `styles/*.yaml` (validated by `schemas/styles/playbook.schema.json`)
- Tool contract: `tools/base_tool.py`
- Tool registry: `tools/tool_registry.py`
- Stage director skills: `skills/pipelines/<pipeline>/<stage>-director.md`
- Meta skills: `skills/meta/*.md`

Checkpoint rules:

- Checkpoints live at `projects/<project_id>/checkpoint_<stage>.json` (the project workspace — this is what the Backlot board watches).
- `status` may be `completed`, `failed`, `awaiting_human`, or `in_progress`.
- Write an `in_progress` checkpoint on entering each stage; during `assets`/`compose`, refresh `metadata.partial_progress` after each completed scene/asset unit — this powers live progress on the board.
- `completed` and `awaiting_human` checkpoints must include the canonical artifact.
- A gated stage (`human_approval_default: true`) can only be written `completed` with `human_approved=True` — the writer raises a GATE VIOLATION otherwise.
- Superseded checkpoints are archived automatically to `projects/<project_id>/history/` — stage re-runs never destroy run history.
- Invalid checkpoints or invalid canonical artifacts are contract violations and should fail fast.

Pipeline manifest rules:

- Pipelines are declarative YAML manifests in `pipeline_defs/`.
- Stages declare: `skill` (director skill path), `produces`, `tools_available`, `review_focus`, `success_criteria`, `human_approval_default`.
- Adding a new pipeline requires a manifest + stage director skills.

Tool rules:

- Every production tool must inherit from `BaseTool`.
- Tool discovery flows through the registry, not ad hoc imports.
- Support-envelope reporting is the source of truth for capability, status, and resource requirements.
