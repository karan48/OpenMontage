## Provider Landscape

### Generation Providers (AI creates the image)

| Tool | Provider | Cost | Speed | Best For |
|------|----------|------|-------|----------|
| `flux_image` | FLUX 2 Pro via fal.ai | ~$0.03-0.05 | ~5-10s | Photorealism, general purpose, workhorse |
| `grok_image` | Grok Imagine Image (xAI) | $0.02/output + $0.002/input edit image | ~5-15s | Image edits, style transfer, multi-image compositing |
| `openai_image` | GPT Image 2 (OpenAI) | ~$0.01-0.21 | ~5-15s | Complex instructions, text in images, multi-element |
| `recraft_image` | Recraft V4 via fal.ai | ~$0.04-0.25 | ~5-10s | Logos, SVG vectors, brand assets, text rendering (see caveat below) |
| `fal_reference_image` | Meta Muse edit (default) / FLUX Kontext via fal.ai | $0.01 (Muse) / $0.04 (Kontext) | ~10-30s | A known character in a new scene from approved reference images; pose/expression/outfit refs; change-one-thing variants. Needs ≥1 reference image. Never chosen for text-only requests |
| `local_diffusion` | Stable Diffusion (local) | Free | ~30s+ | Offline, privacy, free |
| `image_gen` | Multi (legacy, deprecated) | Varies | Varies | **Deprecated** — use `image_selector` or per-provider tools |

### Stock Providers (search and download existing images)

| Tool | Provider | Cost | Speed | Best For |
|------|----------|------|-------|----------|
| `pexels_image` | Pexels | Free | ~2-5s | High-quality photography, color filtering |
| `pixabay_image` | Pixabay | Free | ~2-5s | Large library, category filtering, illustrations |

### Selector

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `image_selector` | Routes to the best available provider based on preference and availability |

## Provider Selection by Scene Type

| Scene Type | Primary Provider | Why | Fallback |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|----------|
| **Real-world photo** (city, nature, people) | `pexels_image` | Real photos > AI for realism | `pixabay_image` → `flux_image` |
| **Technical diagram** | `diagram_gen` | Structured, editable | `flux_image` with diagram prompt |
| **Abstract/conceptual illustration** | `flux_image` | AI excels at custom concepts | `openai_image` |
| **Recurring character in a new scene** (story channels, personas) | `fal_reference_image` with a request built by `lib/character_bible.py` (`skills/meta/character-bible.md`) | Copies identity from approved references: no face drift, no swapped clothes in two-shots | `fal_reference_image` with `model: fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext` (ask first) |
| **Style transfer / repaint of an existing image** | `grok_image` | Native edit flow, strong promptable transforms | `openai_image` |
| **Multi-image merge / composite** | `grok_image` | Can combine multiple source images into one scene | `openai_image` |
| **Logo or brand asset** | `recraft_image` | SVG support, text accuracy | `openai_image` |
| **Faction/rivalry icon system** (flags, military hardware, currency silhouettes — e.g. `infographics-show-explainer`) | `recraft_image` (`icon` style via prompt text, not the `style` param) | Flat silhouette + SVG output, consistent across a whole video | `pixabay_image` with `image_type: "vector"/"illustration"` |
| **Image with text/labels** | `openai_image` | Best text rendering (GPT Image 2) | `recraft_image` |
| **Complex multi-element composition** | `openai_image` | Best instruction following | `flux_image` |
| **Hero image (key visual)** | `flux_image` | Highest visual quality | `openai_image` |
| **Thumbnail** | `flux_image` or `recraft_image` | Needs to be eye-catching | — |
| **Budget/free project** | `pexels_image` or `pixabay_image` | Free, immediate | `local_diffusion` |
| **Offline/air-gapped** | `local_diffusion` | No network needed | — |

## Provider-Specific Caveats

### Recraft V4 via fal.ai
- **`style` parameter causes 422 errors** (confirmed still live 2026-07, originally observed 2026-04). The `style` enum values (`digital_illustration`, `realistic_image`, `vector_illustration`, `icon`, etc.) are rejected by fal.ai's Recraft V4 endpoint. **Workaround:** omit the `style` param entirely and encode the style direction in the prompt text instead (e.g. "flat icon style, minimalist vector icon illustration: ..." rather than `style="icon"`). This is the sanctioned path — verified to produce clean flat/vector output. The `image_size` and `colors` parameters work fine.
- **Text rendering is unreliable for exact business names.** Recraft (like all AI image models) may hallucinate wrong text. For any scene where text must be verbatim (CTA screens, business names, phone numbers), use Remotion `text_card` instead of generating an image with text.
- **Icon generation is supplementary, not load-bearing.** If Recraft is unavailable or the endpoint changes again, fall back to `pixabay_image` with `image_type: "vector"/"illustration"` for flag/faction/hardware icon needs — don't block a production on Recraft specifically.

Use `generation_mode="edit"` when the task starts from an existing image and should route only to edit-capable providers.

## Using the Image Selector

For most cases, use `image_selector` and let it route:

```python
# The selector finds the best available provider
result = image_selector.execute({
    "prompt": "aerial view of a modern data center",
    "preferred_provider": "auto",  # or "flux", "pexels", etc.
    "output_path": "assets/images/scene-3.png"
})
```

Override with `preferred_provider` when you know which provider is best for the scene type.
Use `allowed_providers` to restrict to free or local options:

```python
# Budget mode: only free providers
result = image_selector.execute({
    "prompt": "server room interior",
    "allowed_providers": ["pexels", "pixabay", "local_diffusion"],
    "output_path": "assets/images/scene-3.jpg"
})
```

## Consistency Across Mixed Sources

When mixing stock and generated images in the same video, visual consistency is the challenge.

### Strategy: Color Grade Everything
Apply the playbook's color grading LUT to both stock and generated images in the compose stage.
This unifies the look. The `color_grade` enhancement tool handles this.

### Strategy: Match The Visual Identity, Not A Copied Prefix
When generating images, adapt the playbook's mood, palette, texture, and medium
into a short scene-specific anchor. When searching stock, filter for the same
emotional and visual qualities: color, lighting, environment, composition, era,
and texture. Use the playbook as a consistency source, not a script to paste.

### Strategy: Avoid Mixing Styles Within a Scene
Don't use a stock photo for one element and an AI illustration for another in the same scene.
Keep each scene internally consistent — all stock or all generated.
